# No-Mans-py# No Man's Sky AI Project

## Overview

This project was inspired by the idea of developing an AI that could autonomously play *No Man's Sky*, with a particular focus on exploring the vast, procedurally generated galaxy of Euclid. The AI would aim to learn how to play the game, navigate between planets and star systems, gather resources, interact with alien life, and ultimately explore as much of the galaxy as possible.

## Vision

- **Autonomous Exploration**: The AI would navigate the galaxy, exploring planets, space stations, and star systems, learning how to interact with its surroundings through trial and error. It would need to develop its own strategy for exploration, resource management, and survival.
  
- **Survival Mechanisms**: The AI would understand how to manage hazards such as extreme weather, toxic environments, and hostile creatures. It would gather resources, craft items, and upgrade its equipment to continue its journey across the stars.

- **Adaptation**: Through machine learning techniques, the AI would continually improve its gameplay, adjusting its strategies for travel, resource gathering, and survival. It would evolve its understanding of new planets, alien species, and life forms to become more efficient at exploration.

## Scope of Exploration

The Euclid galaxy, one of the game's many galaxies, contains a near-infinite number of procedurally generated planets—each with its own unique terrain, weather, flora, and fauna. Even with optimal exploration speed, the sheer size of the galaxy makes it nearly impossible for a human or AI to explore entirely.

- **Number of Planets**: Euclid contains **18 quintillion** planets. Assuming that the AI could visit a planet every **1 minute** (an unrealistic best-case scenario), it would take approximately **34 billion years** to explore every planet in Euclid. Since new planets and life forms can always be discovered and cataloged, the AI's task would be never-ending, much like how players experience the game.

- **Discovery of New Life**: The AI would encounter countless new species of alien flora and fauna, documenting and cataloging them as part of its exploration mission. As each planet has unique ecosystems, the AI's ability to adapt to new environments and learn about diverse life forms would be crucial.

## Challenges So Far

- **Procedural Environment**: The vast and constantly changing nature of *No Man's Sky* presents a challenge for an AI, as it would need to dynamically adapt to new and unknown environments with little prior information.
  
- **AI Learning Models**: Training the AI to autonomously explore, gather resources, survive hazards, and interact with alien species in a procedural world would require advanced machine learning techniques and significant computational resources.

- **Time Constraints**: Given the scale of the galaxy, complete exploration is theoretically impossible within a human lifetime, making the AI’s objective more about continual discovery and self-improvement rather than full completion.
